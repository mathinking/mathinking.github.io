A long long time ago (~around 20 years or so), I used to blog frequently on topics that I considered of interest at the time. In the last couple of years, I have been writing LinkedIn posts and articles or using Twitter to share content on topics that I enjoy, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Data Science or Robotics to mention a few. However, such platforms, although technologically great, do not provide the level of flexibility that I sometimes need. Thus, here I am, again.

I will write posts in English and occasionally in Spanish, so I hope not to discourage you as a reader if the entry in question is not written in your language. Online translators are pretty decent today. One day, eventually, we might discuss how they work. 

Sit down, relax and make yourself at home.
