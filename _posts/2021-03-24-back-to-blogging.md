A long time ago (~20 years or so), I used to write frequently on my blog on topics that I considered of interest at the time. Back then, I was using Blogger, a powerful blog-publishing service by [Pyra Labs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyra_Labs), acquired by Google in 2003. 

In the last couple of years, I have been writing LinkedIn posts and articles or using Twitter to share content on topics that I enjoy, such as Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Data Science, or Robotics to mention a few. However, such platforms, although technologically great, do not provide the level of flexibility that I sometimes need. Thus, here I am, again. 

On this occasion, I decided to use [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a powerful website generator designed to easily build minimal, static blogs hosted on [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/). I will be writing posts in [English](/categories/#en) and [Spanish](/categories/#es), so I hope not to discourage you if the specific post you are interested in reading is not written in your preferred language. Online translators are pretty decent today. One day, eventually, we might discuss how they work. 

For now, sit down, relax and make yourself at home.
