## About myself
Hello world! ðŸ‘‹ 

My name is Lucas GarcÃ­a. 

I am a Mathematician with over 15 years of professional experience working in the computer software industry and research.

I am a Senior Product Manager for Deep Learning at MathWorks (creators of MATLAB). I joined MathWorks as a customer-facing engineer in 2008 and have worked with engineers and scientists across industries (aerospace, automotive, industrial automation, energy and utilities, oil and gas, robotics, etc.) to help them tackle real-world problems in Artificial Intelligence. Such problems varied from training Deep Neural Networks and using Computer Vision algorithms to support Automated Driving or Robotics workflows, developing an incremental learning algorithm for Health Monitoring and Predictive Maintenance applications in the cloud, to cleaning a messy dataset. 

I hold a PhD in Applied Mathematics from Universidad Complutense de Madrid and Universidad PolitÃ©cnica de Madrid. My research is focused on how neural networks can be used to solve combinatorial optimization problems.

## About this site
I like to write about things I find interesting. From time to time, I have been using LinkedIn for that, but this seems to be a more convienient way to aggregate my thoughts. I like writing about Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Software Development, Robotics, etc. Hopefully, you'll find such topics interesting too. You can find more about that in the [Blog][Blog] section. Please, note that *all views are my own and do not represent the views of my current or past employers*. Posts will be written in [English](/blog/categories/#en) or [Spanish](/blog/categories/#es).

In the [Talks][Talks] section you can find more about past and upcoming events in which I have or will participate. 

In the [Research][Research] section you can find my research work and publications. I am not a full-time researcher. Pursuing a PhD has been a "hobby" of mine, a challenging one when combined with a full-time job.
